		<p>This is the homepage of the c4jplugin sourceforge project.</p>
		<p>It aims at developing an Eclipse plug-in for the Design by Contract library 
		<a href="http://c4j.sourceforge.net">C4J</a> written by Jonas Bergstr√∂m. This library works
		with any Java project using Java 1.5 or above and has no dependencies on Eclipse.</p>
		<p>However, there is a lot of room for usability improvements concerning the management of
		your contracts and this is where the c4jplugin project fits in.</p>

	<div class="post-content">
		<p>The c4jplugin project is split into two Eclipse plug-ins, <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin.runtime</tt>
		and <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin</tt>. The first is essentially a wrapper plug-in for the c4j.jar
		library of the C4J project. The second extends the Eclipse Platform with contract creation
		and management capabilities.</p>
		<p>These two plug-ins are extensively documented in their corresponding menus on the right.
		Note that this documentation is also integrated into the Eclipse help system when you
		install these plug-ins.</p>
		<p class="tip">Users of <em>Internet Explorer</em> may experience some layout issues
		with the documentation of the plugins. If you can, please use a more decent
		browser.</p>
