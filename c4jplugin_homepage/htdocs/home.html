<h1>Home</h1>
This is the homepage of the c4jplugin sourceforge project.
<br><br>
It aims at developing an 
Eclipse plug-in for the Design by Contract library 
<a href="http://c4j.sourceforge.net">C4J</a> written by Jonas Bergstr√∂m. This library works
with any Java project using Java 1.5 or above and has no dependencies on Eclipse.
<br><br>
However, there is a lot of room for usability improvements concerning the management of
your contracts and this is where the c4jplugin project fits in.<br><br>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
The c4jplugin project is split into two Eclipse plug-ins, <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin.runtime</tt>
and <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin</tt>. The first is essentially a wrapper plug-in for the c4j.jar
library of the C4J project. The second extends the Eclipse Platform with contract creation
and management capabilities.
<br><br>
These two plug-ins are extensively documented in their corresponding menus on the left.
Note that this documentation is also integrated into the Eclipse help system when you
install these plug-ins.
