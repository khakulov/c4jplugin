<h1>Contract Inheritance</h1>
C4J supports full contract inheritance, both for target classes and for contracts
 themselves. If a class is protected by a contract, all extending classes will 
 automatically enforce those contracts as well. Also, if a parent class is protected 
 by a contract and an extending class is protected by another contract, the contracts 
 will be combined for the extending class.
Furthermore, contracts defined for super interfaces to interfaces that a class implements 
will also be enforced.<br><br>

<b>Contract inheritance in C4J works as follows:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Class invariants are merged, except for in constructors where only the 
	target class' own class invariants are verified.</li>
	<li>Pre conditions may not be strengthened, i.e. the contract in the 
	extending class may not disallow a method call that the contract in the parent allows.</li>
	<li>Post conditions may not be weakened, i.e. the contract in the extending 
	class may not allow more outcomes than the contract in the parent.</li>
</ul>

If contracts don't adhere to these rules, it will be discovered during run time 
and a warning will be printed.
