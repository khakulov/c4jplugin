<h1>Todo List</h1>
This is a preliminary list of planned features. It is not ordered in any way:
<ul>
	<li>Create contract templates for classes and methods</li>
	<li>Support refactoring where it makes sense</li>
	<li>A "Goto Contract..." and "Goto Target..." feature</li>
	<li>Some kind of visual overview for the dependencies between
	contracts and their targets</li>
</ul>
