		<td>Although the news entry for the initial 0.1.0 release is missing,
		it happened about 2 weeks ago. Now there is a bugfix release, which
		solves the following problems:
		<ul><li>All problem markers are reported as errors [1560266]</li>
		<li>NPE when changing VM args of SWT launch configurations [1558901]</li>
		<li>contractClass annotation attribute blocks plugin [1558900]</li>
		<li>NPE when starting Eclipse after a fresh install of the plugin [1552981]</li></ul>
		If you are using the Update Site to install new releases, you will have to
		choose "Search for new features to install", instead of "Search for updates
		of the currently installed features" in the Find and Install... Dialog.
		This should be fixed from now on.</td>
