<h1>Features</h1>
The C4J Library supports the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Class invariants.</li>
  <li>Pre conditions.</li>
  <li>Post conditions, with access to return- and pre- values.</li>
  <li>Access to private members of the tested class from the contract implementation.</li>
  <li>Automatic
detection of simple getters (i.e. "pure" methods, that don't change
state), where no class invariant verifications are necessary.</li>
  <li>It is possible to explicit mark methods as "pure" (even methods defined in interfaces).</li>
  <li>Inheritance of contracts, i.e. extending classes inherit the parent's contracts, also overridden methods.</li>
  <li>Contract
refinement, i.e. extending classes may define their own contracts in
which case they are merged according to DBC theory.</li>
  <li>Contracts
for interfaces, i.e. define a contract for an Interface and all
implementing classes (and their sub classes) will verify the contract.</li>
  <li>Combinations of "interface contracts" and "class contracts", works like contract refinement.</li>
  <li>Logging
of contract verifications, it is possible to register loggers that are
notified when contracts are verified, e.g. to support statistics
gathering.</li>
  <li>Possibility to debug contracts in your favorite IDE.</li>
</ul>
