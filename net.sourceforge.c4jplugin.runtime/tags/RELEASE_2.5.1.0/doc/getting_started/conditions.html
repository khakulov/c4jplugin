  <h1>Pre and Post Conditions</h1>
  Pre and post conditions for a method in the target class are defined by implementing a
  method in the contract which has the same parameter signature as the target's method and
  the same name, except that it is prefixed with &quot;pre_&quot; or &quot;post_&quot;,
  respectively.<br>
  
  <h3>Pre Conditions</h3>
  Due to the same parameter signature, pre conditions are invoked right before the
  target method with exactly the same arguments. For an example, click
  <a href="../examples.html#Pre_and_Post_Conditions">here</a>.
  
  <h3>Post Conditions</h3>
  The same as for pre conditions applies also for post conditions, except that they are
  called right after the target method returns. Therefore, they have access to the targets
  state <i>after</i> the target method has returned. 
  <br><br>
  In order to gain access to some
  state information <i>before</i> the method was invoked, you can make use of the
  utility methods <tt>ContractBase.setPreconditionValue(String)</tt> and
  <tt>ContractBase.getPreconditionValue(String)</tt> if your contract extends
  <tt>ContractBase&lt;T&gt;</tt>. Finally, the return value of the target method is given
  by <tt>ContractBase.getReturnValue()</tt>.
