<h1>Under the Hood of C4J</h1>
<p>
C4J use the new <b>-javaagent</b> switch that was added to
Java
1.5. It provides a way to hook on to the class loader, and return
custom byte code for any class that is loaded by the Java runtime. C4J
contain an "instrumentor class" that instruments all loaded classes
that defines a ContractReference annotation with contract verification
code.<br>
<a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/javassist" target="_blank">Javassist</a>, an extremely easy to
use byte code library, is used for instrumenting.</p>

<p>
The C4J instrumentor class does the following on each class that is
loaded:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Does the target class or any of it's parents contain a
valid ContractReference annotation? If not, don't instrument this class.</li>

  <li>If the target class has a direct contract (as opposed to
inherited from
a parent), insert a private member of the contract class in to the
target class.</li>

</ul>
<p>
For each method in the target class:</p>
<ul>

  <li>If
the target class has a direct contract (as opposed to inherited from a
parent), insert a private member of the contract class in to the target
class.</li>

  <li>If a <tt>pre_&lt;method-name&gt;</tt> exists in the contract
or the parents contract, add a call to it at the beginning of the
method.</li>

  <li>If a <tt>post_&lt;method-name&gt;</tt> exists in the
contract or the parents contract, add a call to it at the end of the
method.</li>

  <li>If a classInvariant exists in the contract or the parents
contract, add a call to it at the end of the method.</li>

  <li>For
all of the above, if both a direct contract and an inherited contract
exist for the method, add method calls to both, according to the rules
of contract inheritance.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Apart from this there is more stuff going on if the contract extends
ContractBase; return- and pre- values are made available to post
conditions, and logging hooks are notified of all contract checking.</p>
