<h1>Contracts and Targets</h1>

In C4J, contracts for a class (called the target) are implemented in a
separate class (the contract). The contract class can by of any type,
in any location. However, since you usually do not want to deploy your
contracts together with your final product, it is a good idea to keep
them in a separate source tree (or even a separate project).<br>

<br>

<h3>Connecting Contracts and Target Classes</h3>

The contracts are tied to their targets via the <a href="../javadoc/net/sourceforge/c4j/ContractReference.html"><tt>ContractReference</tt></a>
annotation. The simplest example of a target class and its contract,
wich both do nothing, is:<br>

<pre>@ContractReference(contractClassName="DummyContract")<br>public class Dummy {}<br><br>public class DummyContract {}</pre>

This works if the <tt>Dummy</tt> and <tt>DummyContract</tt>
classes are defined in the
same package. If they are not, you must supply a fully qualified class
name as the value for the <tt>contractClassName</tt> attribute.<br>

<br>

How to write actual contracts for classes and methods is explained in
the sections <a href="class_invariants.html">Class
Invariants</a>, <a href="conditions.html">Pre and
Post Conditions</a> and <a href="target_members.html">Target
Members</a>.<br>

<br>

<h3>Target Access</h3>

Your contract class gains access to its target by defining a
non-standard constructor, which has as its only argument a target
object. This enables the contract to access all but the private members
of its target:<br>

<pre>@ContractReference(contractClassName="DummyContract")
public class Dummy {
    ...
}

public class DummyContract extends ContractBase&lt;Dummy&gt; {
    Dummy m_target;
    
    public DummyContract(Dummy target) {
        m_target = target
    }
    
    ...
}</pre>

If you need to get your hands on private members, see <a href="target_members.html">Target Members</a>.<br>

<br>

<h3>The <tt>ContractBase</tt> class</h3>

The package <tt>net.sourceforge.c4j</tt> contains the generic class
<a href="../javadoc/net/sourceforge/c4j/ContractBase.html"><tt>ContractBase&lt;T&gt;</tt></a>
which is designed in order to give your contracts access to pre
condition values, return values and private members of the target
class. Additionally, you can register a <a href="../javadoc/net/sourceforge/c4j/Logger.html"><tt>Logger</tt></a>
object to track contract verifications, see also the <a href="logging.html">Logging section</a>.for further
details.<br>
