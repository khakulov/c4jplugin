<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This guide is about the Eclipse plug-in <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin.runtime</tt>
and the C4J Library it encapsulates. Most of this documentation has
been extracted from the <a href="http://c4j.sourceforge.net">homepage
of C4J</a>.</p>

<h2>What is C4J and Design by Contract (DBC)</h2>

<p><em>Contracts for Java</em> (C4J) is a <i>Design By
Contract</i> (DBC, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBC" target="_blank">Wikipedia
DBC definition</a> and <a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/" target="_blank">Eiffel DBC docs</a>)
framework for Java 1.5 and later. The primary goal for C4J is ease of
use. DBC is about design and quality, aspects of programming that a lot
programmers don't spend enough time and energy on.</p>

<p>Therefore a DBC framework must be simple and painless to use. At the
same time the framework must be powerful.</p>

<p>C4J is simple <em>and</em> powerful.</p>

<p>
Two favourite ideas of the author of C4J, underlying the philosophy of
Design by Contract, are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>To be able to define meaningful contracts you are forced to
split
lengthy methods in to small, well defined, methods with a single
responsibility. This single "side effect" of DBC has very positive
effects on the code quality, maintainability, and readability.</li>

  <li>Your tests are verified against the <i>real</i>
usage of your application, not against some test cases that may not
even be real use cases.</li>

</ul>

<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>
Adding class invariants, pre conditions, and post conditions to your
regular Java objects is easy with C4J. Contracts for a class (the
target) are implemented in a separate class (the contract). The
contract is linked to the target at compile time using an annotation,
and the actual contract verification code is tied to the target using
instrumentation during class loading at run time.</p>

<p>
Contracts implementations have a reference to the instance of the
target that it is verifying. This reference is used to implement class
invariants. Pre and post conditions also have access to the target
reference, as well as the parameters that the target method is invoked
with. If the contract class extends a C4J ContractBase class, post
conditions will also have access to method return values, and pre
invokation values (i.e. values of instance variables in the target
prior to the method invocation).</p>

<p>
There are several reasons for defining contracts in plain Java and in a
separate class:</p>
<ul>

  <li>You don't have to learn any new language constructs.</li>

  <li>You will get help from your IDE when implementing the
contract (as opposed to implementing contracts in comment blocks).</li>

  <li>It is possible to put break points in your contract if you
want to debug them.</li>

  <li>Separating
the contract code from the application makes it possible to remove the
risk of accidentally deploying the contracts together with your
application.</li>

  <li>You get to keep your beautiful code nice and clean without
all the ugly assertions.</li>

</ul>


<h2>The plug-in <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin.runtime</tt></h2>
<p>
This plug-in is part of the <a href="http://c4jplugin.sourceforge.net">C4JPlugin
sourceforge project</a> and acts as a wrapper for the c4j.jar and
javassist.jar library. In addition, it contains this guide which is
integrated into the Eclipse help system. This eases the use of C4J for
Eclipse developers and constitutes the basis for the <tt>net.sourceforge.c4jplugin</tt>
plug-in. This additional plug-in extends Eclipse with useful
capabilities in order to write and manage contracts more easily. A
description
of it can be found in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">C4J
Plug-in User Guide</span> in the Eclipse help system.</p>
