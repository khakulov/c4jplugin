	<div class="post-content">
		<p>The beautiful connections between mathematics and physics, which are established
		by many of the most significant physical theories, have always attracted me. Below
		you can find a summary of my current field of work or subjects I would like to
		investigate further.</p>
		<h3><a href="#math"></a>Mathematics</h3>
		<p>Currently, I am trying to absorb the vast amount of concepts representing
		the cornerstones of <em>Algebraic Topology</em>. Further, I am interested in
		<em>Riemannian Geometry</em> in order to better understand General Relativity.
		The abstract ideas behind <em>Category Theory</em> are also very fascinating,
		particularly with regard to the process of
		<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/categories.html" target="_blank">Quantization</a>
		and its abstract iteration over the empty set, leading to
		<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nth_quantization.html" target=_blank>nth Quantization</a>.
		Nice!</p>
		<h3><a href="#physics"></a>Physics</h3>
		<p>The conceptual differences between <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> and <em>General Relativity</em>
		have already puzzled me during my physics studies. The merging of these two theories is
		considered as the holy grail among physicists and the quest for it is very exciting. <em>Loop
		Quantum Gravity</em>, <em>String Theory</em> and other exotic theories try to solve the puzzle.
		I also find <em>Classical Mechanics</em> and its formulation via <em>Symplectic Geometry</em>
		quite attractive and should spend more time on it.
