		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			We outline the general theory of quantizing a relativistic massive scalar field on curved
hypersurfaces. The quantization on hyperboloids $X_\mu X^\mu = \text{const.}$, which we call
Point-form quantization, is then discussed in some detail. The current state of Point-form
quantization is reviewed and its present limitations and drawbacks are pointed out. We then

propose a generalized Point-form quantization scheme which differs in two issues from the
conventional approach, namely in the choice of the time variable and the representation
Fock-space. The main feature of Point-form quantization, that interaction terms enter
all the components of the 4-momentum operator, however, remains untouched. Unlike the
conventional approach, a natural formulation of scattering within the generalized
Point-form quantization scheme is possible. As first application we show for our scalar 
quantum field
theory that the $S$-matrix in leading-order perturbation theory is the same as in covariant
perturbation theory.
